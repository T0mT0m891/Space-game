Project title: Space game

This repostery contains the final version of my code. it was created and update when the majority of the development had been completed

At the beginning of this project i wasn't aware that we were expeceted to record each stage of the development using version control. Insted i tracked all the changes in the developement log, explaning every major decision and modification thoughout the process.
Once i've understood the requirement, I created this Github repostery and attempt to reconstruct the version control as best as possible by referring to my logbook. While this may not perfetctly reflect the real-time evolution of my code, it does represent a faithful summary of the key stages and changes made during the development process
